        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Release notes are a concept most of us are familiar with. When a new software
release is prepared, the release notes tell you what changed, so you understand
what you can expect and how to prepare for the update. They are also
occasionally used to facilitate conversations:

Many of the people tasked with writing release notes have never found themselves
on that side of the screen before. If that describes you, I would like to offer
some advice on how to nail it. Note that this mostly applies to free and ope…]]></summary>

relationship with it today is marginal at best. I think that, with hindsight,
I’ve come to understand that the “always online” approach of aerc’s IMAP
implementation is less than ideal. The next email client (which will exist at
some point!) will improve on this design, but, since it’s still my favorite
email client despite these flaws, they will have to be worked around.
To this end, I have updated my personal aerc setup to take advantage…]]></summary>

years ago, when I visited Berlin to work with the KDE developers. Honestly, I
was underwhelmed. The performance was abysmal and ARM is a nightmare to work
with. For these reasons, I was skeptical when I bought the Pinebook Pro. I have
also spoken of my disdain for modern laptops in general before: the state
of laptops in $CURRENTYEAR is abysmal. As such, I have been using a ThinkPad
