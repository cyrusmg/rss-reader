          "description": "Hiya! Got another status update for you. First, let me share this picture that\nmy dad and I took on our recent astronomy trip (click for full res):\n\nBonus Venus:\n\nSo, what’s new? With SourceHut, there are a few neat goings-on. For one, thanks\nto Michael Forney putting the finishing touches on the patchset, the\nlong-awaited NetBSD image is now available for builds.sr.ht. Also, the initial\nlists.sr.ht GraphQL API design is in place, and Simon Ser is working on a new\nand improved implementation of email discussion parsing for us to use. I’ve also\nredesigned the registration & onboarding flow based on a maintainer/contributor\ndistinction, which should help people understand how sourcehut works a bit\nbetter. Also, as promised, the writable GraphQL API for builds.sr.ht is now\navailable.\nI had been working on a new feature for the secret programming language, but in\nthe course of implementing it, it became clear to me that we need to take a step\nback and do some deep refactoring in the compiler. This will probably occupy us\nfor a couple of months. Even so, some improvements in the standard library have\nbeen made and shall continue to be made. You may have seen a few weeks ago that\nI wrote a finger server in the new language, and there’s a bunch of code\nfor you to read there if you’re interested in learning more.\nI also spent some time this month on Simon’s gamja and soju projects.\nLibera.chat is running an experimental instance of gamja for their webchat,\nand I’ve helped Simon incorporate some of their feedback and apply a layer of\npolish to the client. I’m also working on generalizing soju a bit so that we can\neventually utilize it to offer a hosted IRC bouncer for sr.ht users.\nThat’s all I have to share for now. My foci have been on sourcehut and the\nsecret language, and will continue to be those. I plan on advancing the work on\nthe GraphQL APIs for sr.ht and ideally shipping an initial version of the\nlists.sr.ht API in a few weeks. I’ll share more news about the new language when\nit’s ready. Until next time!",

I sent off my visa application\ntoday, and assuming I can navigate the pandemic-modified procedures, I should be\nable to make my move fairly soon. It’s a little bit intimidating, but I am\nlooking forward to it!\nQuick note: I am looking for temporary housing in NL; somewhere I can stay for\n6-12 months with a permanent mailing address for receiving immigration-related\ndocuments.

If you’re\nfeeling adventurous, I would like you to give it a crack in our new systems\nprogramming language, and to use it to drive improvements in the less-developed\nareas of our standard library.\nAre you making a new coreutils implementation? A little OS kernel? A new shell?\nA GUI toolkit? Database system? Web server? Whatever your systems programming\nuse-case, we think that our language is likely to be a good fit for you, and\nyour help in proving that, and spurring development to rise to meet your needs,\nwould be quite welcome.\nHere’s our pitch:\nXXXX is a systems programming language designed to be simple and robust. XXXX\nuses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime.\nIt is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers,\nnetworking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.\nYou can get a peek at how it feels by reading about the finger server I wrote\nwith it.\nSounds interesting?
