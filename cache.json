If you’re\nfeeling adventurous, I would like you to give it a crack in our new systems\nprogramming language, and to use it to drive improvements in the less-developed\nareas of our standard library.\nAre you making a new coreutils implementation? A little OS kernel? A new shell?\nA GUI toolkit? Database system? Web server? Whatever your systems programming\nuse-case, we think that our language is likely to be a good fit for you, and\nyour help in proving that, and spurring development to rise to meet your needs,\nwould be quite welcome.\nHere’s our pitch:\nXXXX is a systems programming language designed to be simple and robust. XXXX\nuses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime.\nIt is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers,\nnetworking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.\nYou can get a peek at how it feels by reading about the finger server I wrote\nwith it.\nSounds interesting?
