If you’re\nfeeling adventurous, I would like you to give it a crack in our new systems\nprogramming language, and to use it to drive improvements in the less-developed\nareas of our standard library.\nAre you making a new coreutils implementation? A little OS kernel? A new shell?\nA GUI toolkit? Database system? Web server? Whatever your systems programming\nuse-case, we think that our language is likely to be a good fit for you, and\nyour help in proving that, and spurring development to rise to meet your needs,\nwould be quite welcome.\nHere’s our pitch:\nXXXX is a systems programming language designed to be simple and robust. XXXX\nuses a static type system, manual memory management, and a minimal runtime.\nIt is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools, compilers,\nnetworking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.\nYou can get a peek at how it feels by reading about the finger server I wrote\nwith it.\nSounds interesting? Please tell me about your project idea!",

The Finger protocol is\nperfect for this! After being designed in the 70’s and then completely forgotten\nabout for 50 years, it’s the perfect small and simple network protocol to test\ndrive this new interface with.\nIn short, finger will reach out to a remote server and ask for information about\na user.
