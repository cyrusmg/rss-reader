— inspiring me to pull out my laptop and write. On this plane, there are
displays in the back of each seat which provides entertainment for the person
seated one row back. Newer planes no longer include these, given that in

set up. The new website isn&rsquo;t right for many projects — one of the most

  disclose your stake in cryptocurrency. I will explain why later in this post.
  For my part, I held &lt;$10,000 USD worth of Bitcoin prior to 2016, plus small
  amounts of altcoins. I made a modest profit on my holdings. Today my stake in
  all cryptocurrency is $0.

development of (some) programming languages: it signals that the language is
mature enough to be comfortably used to implement itself. While this isn&rsquo;t right
for some languages (e.g. shell scripts), for a systems programming language like
ours, this is a crucial step in our bootstrapping plan. Our self-hosted parser
