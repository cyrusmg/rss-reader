                    <span>One of the projects I’ve been tinkering with constantly for the past nine months or so that we’ve lived at our new house is home automation. I’ve been into home automation since about 1996 and have had a fully automated house ever since 2003 or so. Even my RV was so automated that it unlocked… Continue reading Home Automation</span>

                    <span>This is a short follow-up to the io_uring finger server article posted
about a month ago. In the time since, we have expanded our language with a more
complete networking stack, most importantly by adding a DNS resolver. I have
used these improvements to write a small client implementation of the finger
protocol.

                    <span>Hiya! Got another status update for you. First, let me share this picture that
my dad and I took on our recent astronomy trip (click for full res):

Bonus Venus:

So, what’s new? With SourceHut, there are a few neat goings-on. For one, thanks
to Michael Forney putting the finishing touches on the patchset, the
long-awaited NetBSD image is now available for builds.sr.ht. Also, the initial
lists.sr.ht GraphQL API design is in place, and Simon Ser is working on a new
and improved implementation of email discussion parsing for us to use. I’ve also
redesigned the registration &amp; onboarding flow based on a maintainer/contributor
distinction, which should help people understand how sourcehut works a bit
better. Also, as promised, the writable GraphQL API for builds.sr.ht is now
available.
I had been working on a new feature for the secret programming language, but in
the course of implementing it, it became clear to me that we need to take a step
back and do some deep refactoring in the compiler. This will probably occupy us
for a couple of months. Even so, some improvements in the standard library have
been made and shall continue to be made. You may have seen a few weeks ago that
I wrote a finger server in the new language, and there’s a bunch of code
for you to read there if you’re interested in learning more.
I also spent some time this month on Simon’s gamja and soju projects.
Libera.chat is running an experimental instance of gamja for their webchat,
and I’ve helped Simon incorporate some of their feedback and apply a layer of
polish to the client. I’m also working on generalizing soju a bit so that we can
eventually utilize it to offer a hosted IRC bouncer for sr.ht users.
That’s all I have to share for now. My foci have been on sourcehut and the
secret language, and will continue to be those. I plan on advancing the work on
the GraphQL APIs for sr.ht and ideally shipping an initial version of the
lists.sr.ht API in a few weeks. I’ll share more news about the new language when
it’s ready. Until next time!</span>

                    <span>I had been planning a move to the Netherlands for a while, at least until a
large COVID-shaped wrench was thrown into the gears. However, I was fully
vaccinated by early April, and there are signs of the border opening up now, so
my plans have been slowly getting back on track. I sent off my visa application
today, and assuming I can navigate the pandemic-modified procedures, I should be
able to make my move fairly soon. It’s a little bit intimidating, but I am
looking forward to it!
Quick note: I am looking for temporary housing in NL; somewhere I can stay for
6-12 months with a permanent mailing address for receiving immigration-related
