                    <span>I am the original author of the aerc mail client, though my official
relationship with it today is marginal at best. I think that, with hindsight,
I’ve come to understand that the “always online” approach of aerc’s IMAP
implementation is less than ideal. The next email client (which will exist at
some point!) will improve on this design, but, since it’s still my favorite
email client despite these flaws, they will have to be worked around.
To this end, I have updated my personal aerc setup to take advantage…</span>

internet, so I could not prepare these. After my sister and I got vaccinated, I
took a trip to visit her at her home in beautiful Hawaii — it felt great
after a year of being trapped within these same four walls. I hope you get that
vaccine and things start to improve for you, too!

                    <span>I received the original Pinebook for free from the good folks at Pine64 a few
years ago, when I visited Berlin to work with the KDE developers. Honestly, I
was underwhelmed. The performance was abysmal and ARM is a nightmare to work
with. For these reasons, I was skeptical when I bought the Pinebook Pro. I have
also spoken of my disdain for modern laptops in general before: the state
of laptops in $CURRENTYEAR is abysmal. As such, I have been using a ThinkPad

— inspiring me to pull out my laptop and write. On this plane, there are
displays in the back of each seat which provides entertainment for the person
seated one row back. Newer planes no longer include these, given that in
$CURRENTYEAR everyone would just prefer some power for their phone or laptop.

documentation for. To continue serving the needs of projects which preferred the

for some languages (e.g. shell scripts), for a systems programming language like
ours, this is a crucial step in our bootstrapping plan. Our self-hosted parser
