Hey! If you write a comment about this article online,
  disclose your stake in cryptocurrency. I will explain why later in this post.
  For my part, I held &lt;$10,000 USD worth of Bitcoin prior to 2016, plus small
  amounts of altcoins. I made a modest profit on my holdings. Today my stake in

                <p>One of the things we&rsquo;re working on in my new programming language is a
self-hosting compiler. Having a self-hosted compiler is a critical step in the
development of (some) programming languages: it signals that the language is
mature enough to be comfortably used to implement itself. While this isn&rsquo;t right
for some languages (e.g. shell scripts), for a systems programming language like
ours, this is a crucial step in our bootstrapping plan. Our self-hosted parser
design was completed this week, …</p>
