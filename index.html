                      <span>I received the original Pinebook for free from the good folks at Pine64 a few
years ago, when I visited Berlin to work with the KDE developers. Honestly, I
was underwhelmed. The performance was abysmal and ARM is a nightmare to work
with. For these reasons, I was skeptical when I bought the Pinebook Pro. I have
also spoken of my disdain for modern laptops in general before: the state
of laptops in $CURRENTYEAR is abysmal. As such, I have been using a ThinkPad

— inspiring me to pull out my laptop and write. On this plane, there are
displays in the back of each seat which provides entertainment for the person
seated one row back. Newer planes no longer include these, given that in
$CURRENTYEAR everyone would just prefer some power for their phone or laptop.

ours, this is a crucial step in our bootstrapping plan. Our self-hosted parser
